# deform_conv_pytorch

## Statement
- The **main.py** from [MorvanZhou](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/PyTorch-Tutorial/blob/master/tutorial-contents/401_CNN.py),  and I change some code. His videos help me a lot, thank him!  
- The ** conv_offset2D.py ** from [oeway](https://github.com/oeway/pytorch-deform-conv), and I change some code. Through his code, it is easy for me to understand deformable convolution, thank him!  
- The ** deform_conv_my.py ** is transformed from the tensorflow version code of [maestrojeong](https://github.com/maestrojeong/deformable_convnet) to pytorch, but it's still something wrong in my code.  

## main.py
In this code, I use a simple convolutional network and a simple deformable convolutional network to do the mnist jobs.
